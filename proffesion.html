            <p>
              I'm double majoring in Computer Science and statistics. A little
              fun fact about me is that, I chose my major last minute in high school
              since I never really found a passion for anything and I feel
              as though I made the right decision. Additionally, I'm not in a CCT
              program, and I am solely taking the technical courses of CCT.
            </p>
            <p>
              I really enjoy the porgram and have learned alot. I am fluent and
              comfortable with languages such as.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>R</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            I have completed a number of personal projects ranging from
            an image editor program, which I have a picture of above, to
            a STEAM Marketplace algorithm, which I have displayed a snippet
            of the source code below.

            <h1> Proffesion </h1>
            <p>
                Once completing my undergrad, I plan to pursue a career within the IT
                field. Since enrolling in my major, one of the reasons I was comfortable
                with doing computer science was that I felt comfortable with all
                ranges of job types of a programmer.
            </p>

            <p>
              As mentioned before, I have been such a big Basketball fan dating
              back to when I was a little kid. There is a alot of involvement
              with the NBA's use of Data Science and statistics. Landing a Software
              position with the NBA is one of my goals as a programmer, and am
              hoping I will come across an opportunity like such in my life.
