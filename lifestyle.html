            <h1> Music and Friends </h1>
            <p>
                Some hobbies in my everyday life is keeping in touch with my friends,
                and listening to music, and every so often, mix the two and listen to music
                with my friends. During the pandemic, it is pretty tough to meet up
                with your friends since I find myself to be more social in
                face-to-face interactions and always am open to meeting new
                people, however, we find many alternatives to still
                keep in touch with one another.

              As for music, I really enjoy music and listen to Hip-Hop as well
              as many other genres. Some artists I enjoy listening to are:

            <h1> Basketball </h1>
            <p>
                Basketball, without a doubt is one of the biggest components
                to my life and enjoyment. I was introduced to the sport by my older siblings
                and enjoyed playing, watching when I was in grade 2, and my love
                for it has exponentially growed ever since.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've always been a really big raptors fan, and I can watch, talk, and play
              Basketball for hours. I've involved myself in Basketball teams at school
              for a number of years and always enjoyed playing with others. This, in a
              way relates to my social life since I believe something like Basketball
              brings many people closer, since it often goes beyond the sport, something
              I greatly admire.
